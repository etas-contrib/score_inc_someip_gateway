# benchmark_event_transmission_client_to_server profiling analysis

## Scope
- Benchmark target: `//src/gateway_ipc_binding/benchmark:gateway_ipc_binding_benchmark`
- Benchmark case profiled: `benchmark_event_transmission_client_to_server/1024/manual_time`
- Build mode used for final analysis: `-c opt --features=-tsan`
- Profiling command: `perf record -F 999 -g --call-graph dwarf,16384`

## Artifacts
- Flamegraph (final, non-TSan): `profiling/event_transmission_client_to_server_1024_notsan_flamegraph.svg`
- Perf data (final, non-TSan): `profiling/perf_event_c2s_1024_notsan_ok.data`
- Folded stacks: `profiling/perf_event_c2s_1024_notsan_ok.folded`
- Percent summary: `profiling/perf_event_c2s_1024_notsan_ok_percent_summary.txt`

## Benchmark result used for profile
- `benchmark_event_transmission_client_to_server/1024/manual_time`: **4382 ns** manual time, 4210 ns CPU time (139426 iterations, 222.851 MiB/s)
- Previous result: ~5228 ns manual time
- **Improvement: ~16.2% latency reduction**

## Important caveat
An initial profile was collected while ThreadSanitizer instrumentation was active due `user.bazelrc` containing `common --features=tsan`. That profile was dominated by `__tsan_*` internals and is not representative for release bottlenecks. Final analysis below uses the non-TSan profile.

## Bottlenecks (non-TSan)
Percentages below are cumulative stack presence from folded stacks and indicate where execution time is spent across call paths.

1. Syscall and scheduler heavy path
- `entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe`: ~74.15%
- `do_syscall_64`: ~73.13%
- `x64_sys_call`: ~69.68%
- `schedule` + `__schedule`: ~30.38% combined cumulative presence
- Interpretation: the event transmission path remains dominated by kernel transitions, waiting/wakeup, and scheduling overhead rather than payload processing. Proportions are broadly similar to the previous profile.

2. Poll/recv/send loop overhead
- `score::os::SysPollImpl::poll`: ~26.22%
- `__GI___poll`: ~25.56%
- `score::os::SocketImpl::recvmsg`: ~30.74%
- `score::os::SocketImpl::sendmsg`: ~8.78%
- `do_sys_poll`: ~21.39%, `__x64_sys_recvmsg`: ~28.49%, `__x64_sys_sendmsg`: ~8.07%
- Interpretation: recv-side costs have increased relative to send-side — `recvmsg` now dominates over `sendmsg` more than before (30.7% vs 8.8%), suggesting the receive path is a larger proportion of the workload. Poll overhead remains a central cost.

3. Message handling and dispatch path
- `score::message_passing::detail::ClientConnection::ProcessInputEvent`: ~33.26%
- `score::message_passing::UnixDomainEngine::ReceiveProtocolMessage`: ~31.23%
- `score::message_passing::detail::UnixDomainServer::ServerConnection::ProcessInput`: ~13.95%
- `score::gateway_ipc_binding::Gateway_ipc_binding_base::handle_event_update_message`: ~7.08%
- `score::gateway_ipc_binding::Gateway_ipc_binding_base::handle_request_service_message`: ~7.63%
- `score::gateway_ipc_binding::Gateway_ipc_binding_base::handle_payload_consumed_message`: ~6.47%
- Interpretation: client-side input processing (`ProcessInputEvent` at 33.3%) now appears more prominently than server-side processing (`ProcessInput` at 14.0%). The `handle_event_update_message` cost dropped from ~11.9% to ~7.1%, indicating the event handling path itself has been optimized.

4. Shared memory management overhead (new finding)
- `score::gateway_ipc_binding::Shared_memory_managers::payload_consumed`: ~5.16%
- `unordered_map::erase` (shared memory allocation map): ~4.00%
- `Shared_memory_allocation::~Shared_memory_allocation`: ~3.64%
- `Read_only_shared_memory_payload::__on_zero_shared`: ~3.34%
- Interpretation: shared memory slot lifecycle management (allocation tracking via hash map, destruction of allocation entries, shared_ptr reference counting) contributes ~16% cumulative cost. This is a newly visible bottleneck now that other paths have improved.

5. Synchronization overhead
- `std::__1::mutex::lock`: ~4.99%
- `__GI___lll_lock_wait`: ~4.47%
- `std::__1::condition_variable::wait`: ~4.21%
- `do_futex` / `futex_wait`: ~10.49% / ~8.24%
- `std::__1::shared_ptr::~shared_ptr` / `__release_shared`: ~7.26% / ~7.04%
- Interpretation: mutex contention and futex-based waiting are significant. Shared pointer reference counting (`~shared_ptr` at 7.1%, `__release_shared` at 7.3%) is a notable cost, likely from per-event payload lifetime management.

6. Kernel-side micro-costs (leaf signals)
- `fdget`: ~2.63%
- `simple_copy_to_iter`: ~3.93%
- `copy_msghdr_from_user`: ~4.34%
- `consume_skb` / `kfree_skbmem` / `kmem_cache_free`: ~8.21% / ~3.87% / ~3.87%
- Interpretation: socket buffer allocation/deallocation and data copy operations in the kernel are a steady overhead. The `consume_skb` path (8.2%) is notable — each message send triggers SKB allocation and freeing.

## Improvement suggestions
Prioritized by expected impact and implementation risk.

1. Reduce syscall frequency per event (highest impact)
- Batch event updates where semantics allow.
- Coalesce notifications and transmit multiple updates in one message.
- Prefer fewer, larger transfers over many small transfer operations.
- Why: the profile remains syscall-bound (~74% in kernel transitions); fewer transitions directly lower end-to-end cost.

2. Optimize shared memory slot lifecycle (new recommendation)
- The `unordered_map::erase` + destructor path for `Shared_memory_allocation` costs ~16% combined.
- Consider a slot pool with index-based lookup instead of hash map insert/erase per event.
- Reuse allocation entries rather than creating and destroying them each time.
- Why: this is a newly prominent bottleneck after event handling optimizations.

3. Replace or reduce poll wakeups
- If feasible in the transport layer, move from poll loop patterns toward readiness/eventfd integration with less wake-sleep churn.
- Tune poll timeout and wake strategy to avoid frequent short sleeps.
- Why: `poll` and scheduler frames are consistently dominant (~26% and ~30% respectively).

4. Reduce mutex contention in hot callbacks
- `mutex::lock` + `lll_lock_wait` together cost ~9.5%.
- Review whether a lock-free or reader-writer pattern can replace the mutex on the event delivery path.
- Consider per-connection locks to reduce contention scope.
- Why: lock contention directly adds latency to each event round-trip.

5. Reduce kernel socket buffer churn
- `consume_skb` + `kmem_cache_free` together cost ~12%.
- If the transport supports it, use pre-allocated socket buffers or zero-copy sendmsg paths.
- Why: kernel-side buffer lifecycle is a material per-message cost.

## Comparison with previous profile

| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Benchmark latency | ~5228 ns | ~4382 ns | **-16.2%** |
| `entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe` | 72.31% | 74.15% | +1.84pp |
| `handle_event_update_message` | 11.92% | 7.08% | **-4.84pp** |
| `SysPollImpl::poll` | 25.76% | 26.22% | +0.46pp |
| `SocketImpl::recvmsg` | 24.77% | 30.74% | +5.97pp |
| `SocketImpl::sendmsg` | 16.79% | 8.78% | **-8.01pp** |
| `schedule` + `__schedule` | 32.01% | 30.38% | -1.63pp |
| Shared memory map ops | not visible | ~16% | new |
| `shared_ptr` ref counting | not visible | ~14% | new |

Key takeaways:
- The event update handling path (`handle_event_update_message`) improved significantly (-4.84pp), contributing to the 16% latency reduction.
- The send path cost dropped substantially (`sendmsg`: 16.8% → 8.8%), suggesting fewer or more efficient send operations.
- Shared memory management and reference counting costs are now visible as the next optimization targets.
- Overall syscall dominance remains — the workload is still kernel-bound.

## Stability note
- The profiled run completed successfully with 139426 iterations and no failures.
- Previous stability issue (`Failed to send or receive benchmark event`) was not observed in this run.
