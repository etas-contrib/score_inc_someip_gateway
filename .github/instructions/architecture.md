# Architecture & Key Patterns

## Project Overview

The S-CORE SOME/IP Gateway bridges the SCORE middleware with SOME/IP communication stacks. It's divided into two architectural components with an IPC isolation boundary:
- **gatewayd**: Network-independent gateway logic (C++)
- **someipd**: SOME/IP stack binding (C++)

The gateway also includes Rust examples and comprehensive Python integration tests.

## Core Components

- [src/gatewayd/](../../src/gatewayd/) - Main daemon
- [src/config](../../src/config/) configuration via FlatBuffers
- [src/socom/](../../src/socom/) - Service Oriented Communication abstraction with plugin interface for IPC binding
- [src/someipd/](../../src/someipd/) - SOME/IP binding layer

## Design Patterns

- Configuration injection via FlatBuffers binary (see [main.cpp](../../src/gatewayd/main.cpp) for loading pattern)
- JSON schemas validate configuration ([mw_someip_config.schema.json](../../src/config/mw_someip_config.schema.json))
- Software elements not allowed to allocate on the heap after they have fully started:
  - [src/socom](../../src/socom/)
  - [src/gatewayd](../../src/gatewayd/)
