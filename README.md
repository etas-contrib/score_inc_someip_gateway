# SOME/IP Gateway

The gateway is divided into a gateway daemon (gatewayd) which contains the network-independent logic (payload serialization, etc.) and the SOME/IP daemon (someipd) which binds to the concrete SOME/IP stack.
The IPC interface between the gatewayd and the someipd serves as isolation boundary between ASIL and QM context and also allows to replace the network stack without touching the main gateway logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-score/inc_someip_gateway.git
cd inc_someip_gateway
```

### Start the daemons

Start the daemons in this order:

```sh
bazel run //src/gatewayd
```

and in a separate terminal

```sh
bazel run //src/someipd
```

### Run Example app

```sh
bazel run //examples/car_window_sim:car_window_controller
```

If you type `open` or `close` the command will be sent via network.


### QEMU x86_64 - based integration test and unit tests

For integration tests and unit tests, ITF framework is used, main branch commit e994cb6.
For integration tests where the communication between two QEMU instances is required, a custom implementation is used to start and manage the QEMU instances within the test logic. This is because ITF does not support starting multiple QEMU instances in parallel yet.

Start by  building the QEMU images and the dependant c++ binaries/ libraries / configuration files. Any change will be automatically detected.

```sh
bazel build //deployment/qemu:someip_gateway_ifs --config=x86_64-qnx
```
For the QEMU QNX x864 image to run on host please run the script deployment/qemu/setup_bridge.sh with sudo privileges to setup the required network bridge and tap interfaces.The QEMU instances can be started manually if needed for debugging or development purposes.

```sh
bazel run //deployment/qemu:run_qemu_1 --config=x86_64-qnx
bazel run //deployment/qemu:run_qemu_2 --config=x86_64-qnx
```

SSH into each instance is available:
```sh
ssh root@192.168.87.2 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
ssh root@192.168.87.3 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

Those QEMU instances are pre-configured (IP addresses, multicast route, ...). The tests will start the required processes (gatewayd, someipd, example app) and then run the test logic.

Unit tests are defined by the bazel `test_ut` target:

```sh
bazel test //tests/UT:test_ut --test_output=all  --config=x86_64-qnx
```

For Integration tests Host to QEMU communication:

```sh
bazel test //tests/integration:test_qemu_network_single --test_output=all --config=x86_64-qnx
```
For integration tests QEMU to QEMU communication (dual instance test):

```sh
bazel test //tests/integration:test_qemu_network_dual --test_output=all  --config=x86_64-qnx
```
Execute SOMEIP SD tests:
Execute in seperate terminals for each instance:

```sh
deployment/qemu/setup_qemu_1.sh
deployment/qemu/setup_qemu_2.sh
```

Save the SOMEIP SD communication via tcpdump on the host `virbr0` interface:

```sh
sudo tcpdump -i virbr0 -w someip_capture.pcap "host 192.168.87.2 or host 192.168.87.3"
```
Use Wireshark or provided utility analyze_pcap_someip.py to oberve the SOMEIP SD communication in the capture file.
When finished use `pkill -9 qemu-system` to stop the QEMU instances.

//TODO: add python test to automatically check the SOMEIP SD communication in the pcap file and validate the expected behavior (e.g. correct service discovery, ...)

## QNX Build

Either use a `.netrc` file to provide the login credentials for your myQNX account or provide them as environment variables `SCORE_QNX_USER` and `SCORE_QNX_PASSWORD`.
You can use an extension like `pomdtr.secrets` to manage the secrets or inject it via environment.

The QNX toolchain is automatically downloaded when building for QNX.
If the automatic download via bazel fails for some reason you can also provide the manually downloaded file in a directory which you then pass via the `--distdir` command line option.

Make sure your qnx license file is available as `/opt/score_qnx/license/licenses` (e.g. by copying it from your `~/.qnx/license/licenses`)

If you use a license server then add the following in in your `~/.bazelrc`:

    common --action_env=QNXLM_LICENSE_FILE=<port>@<license_server_host>

> :warning: Getting license from server not yet supported within devcontainer. Need to figure out how to adjust user & hostname properly.
