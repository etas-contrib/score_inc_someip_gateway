# Setup bridge networking for QEMU instances
# This script creates a bridge (virbr0) and configures it for QEMU networking.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./setup_bridge.sh          # Create bridge and configure it
#   sudo ./setup_bridge.sh teardown # Remove bridge and clean up
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - bridge-utils package (brctl command)
#   - iproute2 package (ip command)
#   - Linux kernel with bridging support
#   - Root privileges
#
# Network layout:
#   Bridge: virbr0
#   IP: 192.168.87.1/24
#   QEMU Instance 1: 192.168.87.2
#   QEMU Instance 2: 192.168.87.3
#


#WORK IN PROGRESS - initial version with bridge setup and TAP device creation for ITF compatibility.
#USE IT at  your own risk
