TC8 SOME/IP Conformance Testing
================================

This section defines the requirements, test specifications, and traceability
for `OPEN Alliance TC8 <https://opensig.org/tech-committee/tc8-automotive-ethernet-ecu-test-specification/>`_
SOME/IP conformance testing of the SOME/IP Gateway.

The TC8 test suite covers two scopes:

- **Protocol Conformance** — Tests ``someipd`` at the wire level using raw
  UDP/TCP sockets and the ``someip`` Python package. No application processes
  are needed. ``someipd`` runs in ``--tc8-standalone`` mode.

- **Application-Level Tests** — Tests the full gateway path
  (mw::com client → ``gatewayd`` → ``someipd`` → network) using C++ apps
  built on ``score::mw::com``. These tests are stack-agnostic.

All tests live under ``tests/tc8_conformance/`` and share the ``tc8`` /
``conformance`` Bazel tags. For the architectural overview, test topology
diagrams, and module structure, see
:doc:`/architecture/tc8_conformance_testing`.

.. note::

   Protocol conformance tests run ``someipd`` in ``--tc8-standalone`` mode.
   Fixture defaults (DUT IP, tester IP, port numbers) are defined in
   ``tc8_itf_conftest.py``.  To run all protocol conformance tests::

      bazel test --config=tc8-itf //tests/tc8_conformance/...

   For QNX x86_64 use ``--config=tc8-itf-qnx``.
